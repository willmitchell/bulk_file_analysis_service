This file is a heavily modified version of the original Ice "Hello" demo.
The idea is that you could use this, over a manually configured SSH connection
that may include port forwarding, to run expensive calculations on a backend
supercomputer.

The protocol provided by this service is about as simple as it can be, which
makes this really just a proof of concept.

To run this first start the server:

$ python Server.py

In a separate window, start the client:

$ python Client.py
